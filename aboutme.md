Hi! My name is Prashant Kumar. I am very bad at describing myself, so I still have not completed this section of the website. Here are some of the things I will quickly highlight about me:

- 2 years of experience performing Pentration Testing, Source Code Reviews and Network assessments
- Offensive Security Certified Expert (OSCE)
- Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP)
- Acknowledgement from Microsoft, Oracle, HackerOne, Medium

Quick ways of reaching me would be a DM on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/notsoshant) or mailing at notsoshant [at] protonmail [dot] com
