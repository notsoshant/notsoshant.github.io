Hi! My name is Prashant Kumar. I'm a Security Analyst who loves hacking Web Apps and Networks and Windows and what not! My professional experience would be a total of 3 years but I've been in involved in infosec since 2010. I'm Offensive Security Certified Expert (OSCE) and Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP). I've also found and reported bugs in Microsoft, Oracle (CVE-2018-2807), Medium and HackerOne along with hundreds of other assessments I've performed at work.

Quick ways of reaching me would be a DM on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/notsoshant) or mailing at notsoshant [at] protonmail [dot] com
