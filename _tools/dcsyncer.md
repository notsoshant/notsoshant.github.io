DCSyncer is a tool that performs DCSync operation. It is derived from mimikatz. This is first time I have worked with Windows Programming, plus first time going through the mimikatz code to understand its working. So, the code may look amateurish.

Currently, this tool will dump hashes for all users, single user hash dump is not supported.

## Usage

Just download the tool from releases and run it. It doesn't require any command line arguments.
